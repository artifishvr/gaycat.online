## Updating the list

### GitHub Pull Requests

For an addition, add the new person to the top `src/cats/cats.json`. For the icon, add an image with a appropriate name to `src/cats/pfps/` and use that name (including extension) for the `icon` property. Images will be optimized by Astro at build time, but please try to keep it under 2048x2048 pixels or 10MB.

For a removal, follow those steps in reverse, but ideally use a github account tied to the person to be removed or provide proof of ownership/authorization in your PR.

### GitHub Issues

You can also open an issue to update the list.

For an addition, include:

- Name
- Image (uploaded to github, or link)
- Link (Social media, website, linktree, etc)

For a removal, include:

- Name
- Ideally use a github account tied to the person to be removed.
