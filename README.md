## Updating the list

There's two ways to get the list updated:

### 1. Pull request

If you're a developer, you can make a pull request to update the list. Just edit the `cats` array in `src/cats.ts` and submit a PR. If adding, make sure it follows the format of the other entries in the array, use a trusted source for the image (bsky, discord, twitter, imgur, etc.).

### 2. Issue

You can also open an issue to update the list. Just include the name if you want a removal. If adding, include an image (can be uploaded to github), a name, and a link to a profile or linktree/caard.
